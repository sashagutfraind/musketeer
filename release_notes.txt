2012-04-16: Version 0.90:
---------------------------------
Changes
-New parameter 'preserve_clustering_on_deletion' improves accuracy of the clustering metric in replicas for highly clustered original networks

2012-04-04: Version 0.89:
---------------------------------
Changes
-Optional algorithm that alternatives between deletion and insertion
-Optional algorithm for fine insertion of edges at distance 2 in order to avoid damaging clustering.

2012-03-06: Version 0.88:
---------------------------------
Changes
-Deferential detachment and edge_welfare mechanisms.
-New way of computing locality

Bug fixes
-Clustering is handled better

~sasha.


2012-02-13: Version 0.87:
---------------------------------
Changes
- Records the random generator seed in case the replication must be replicated.
- edge weights are now used during coarsening and propagated down the v-cycle
  during coarsening, node u attaches to the neighboring seed with the strong edge weight (seed,u) 
  however, the final graph does not retain the weights
- more straight-forward handling of new edges
- improved debugging support

Bug fixes
- handling of horizon in a special case
